        <h1>You Have Been Phished!</h1>
        <p>Don't worry, this was just a simulation to help you learn about phishing attacks.</p>
        <p>Here’s what just happened:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You received an email that appeared to be from a trusted source.</li>
            <li>You were asked to click on a link to verify your account.</li>
            <li>You entered your credentials on a fake login page.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tips">
            <h2>How to Avoid Phishing Attacks:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Always check the sender’s email address for authenticity.</li>
                <li>Look for signs of urgency or threats—these are common in phishing emails.</li>
                <li>Never click on links in emails unless you are sure they are legitimate.</li>
                <li>Hover over links to see the actual URL before clicking.</li>
                <li>Enable two-factor authentication for an extra layer of security.</li>
            </ul>
